what is the zero point?

maybe can be from `virtual environment` , for example `vmware workstation`

and `linux system`, for example `debian` 

and `container runtime`, for example `containerd`

and `contianer cluster`, for example `kubernetes`

and build the all of whole software for source, test, build, security, ship, monitor, operation





the project be driven by data

user through define the data object, base the already data structure and custom the data structure and command, of course it not enough for all, i will fill it in some future after, yes i can do that





i will use the `golang` program language, because it can through the life of develop, for example `host agent`, `server`, `interactive`, and maybe it not just so 















maybe someone don't need the base thing, but always someone need, we build for need, follow people's wishes
