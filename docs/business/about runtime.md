source code not only one original point

at the first, we think it  can from language structure, so i can use some tool build the language for archive package for running

source-code manager like `gitlab`

build tool like `jenkins`, `gitlab-ci` and etc.

language structure like `maven` for `java`, `go builder` for `golang` and etc.

archive package like `docker` for `container`

container registry like `habor`

runtime describe like `kubernetes choreography manifest` 







we will around some angle to build: performance/stable/agile/security/ecology/cost/real-time/open/cooperation
